## This game-of-greed

- Define a GameLogic class in game_of_greed/game_logic.py file.
- Handle calculating score for dice roll:

- [x]Add calculate_score static method to GameLogic class

- [x] The input to calculate_score is a tuple of integers that represent a dice roll.

- [x] The output from calculate_score is an integer representing the rollâ€™s score according to rules of game.

- Handle rolling dice:

- [x] Add roll_dice static method to GameLogic class.

- [x] The input to roll_dice is an integer between 1 and 6.

- [x] The output of roll_dice is a tuple with random values between 1 and 6.
- [x] The length of tuple must match the argument given to roll_dice method.
- Handle banking points:
- [x] Define a Banker class
- [x]Add a shelf instance method
- [x]Input to shelf is the amount of points (integer) to add to shelf.
- [x]shelf should temporarily store unbanked points.
- Add a bank instance method:
- [x]bank should add any points on the shelf to total and reset shelf to 0.
- [x]bank output should be the amount of points added to total from shelf.
- Add a clear_shelf instance method:
- [x]clear_shelf should remove all unbanked points

## Testing Details:

### Calculate Score

- [x] zilch - roll with no scoring dice should return 0

- [x] ones - rolls with various number of 1s should return correct score

- [x] twos - rolls with various number of 2s should return correct score

- [x] threes - rolls with various number of 3s should return correct score
- [x] fours - rolls with various number of 4s should return correct score

- [x] fives - rolls with various number of 5s should return correct score

- [x] sixes - rolls with various number of 6s should return correct score

- [x] straight - 1,2,3,4,5,6 should return correct score

- [x] three_pairs - 3 pairs should return correct score

- [x] two_trios - 2 sets of 3 should return correct score

- [x] leftover_ones - 1s not used in set of 3 (or greater) should return correct score

- [x] leftover_fives - 5s not used in set of 3 (or greater) should return correct score

### Banker

- shelf:
- [x] should properly track unbanked points
- bank:
- [x] should properly add unbanked points to total and return the deposited amount
- clear_shelf:
- [x] should remove any unbanked points, resetting to zeroant it should not affect previously banked points
